<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5224" src="http://productivity.mmoser.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dd1.jpg" alt="dd1" />We have all been there. We work hard to ensure a complete design presentation shows the very best solutions for the client but then the client team seems to be unable to make decisions we need in order to move the project forward.

This can lead to presenting over and over again with little progress made to nail things down. The team returns to the office saying “I just can’t get them to decide. We just go around in circles. They keep asking for more options.”

It is especially frustrating when working to time constraints. The lack of solid decision making now will domino through the next steps throwing everything into disarray or jeopardizing the project itself. Why won’t the client, who hired you to be their advisor, take your best advice even though you crafted a flawless presentation?

<h4>What can designers do to make clients see the light and accept the wisdom they were hired to provide? Why do decisions come so slowly? </h4>

What do you notice about the client comments and behaviours as you are presenting? Are they implying they have confidence and that there is trust? Or is trust lacking? We can observe and hear the way client teams respond in meetings.

<h4>Genuinely have empathy for the client’s situation</h4>

There are a many ways in which a client or key contact in the client team may be dealing with the duties of being responsible for a workplace project. Some are very experienced in running such project and others are experiencing it for the first time. Try seeing things form the client’s point of view. There are many possible scenarios but here are a few.

<strong>What other examples can you think of?</strong>

Look at our own actions as well. In the desire to do a good job and meet the project goals and deadlines are we intentionally or inadvertently putting pressure on the client to make decisions?

		<div class="large-6 columns">
			<span class="quote">Our client or even the entire client team may feel we are hammering them for decisions under threat of failure if they don’t make the decisions you require. This can be a form of bullying from designers even if they have the best of intentions. To get the right decisions we need to understand and empathise with their reluctance to make choices or decisions and explain things in a caring way.

All of this can make clients put off committing themselves until every unknown is known. To take the risks with you they must trust that you understand them and have their backs. They must trust you as an advisor. Trust must be earned and maintained and we must always be worthy that trust placed in us. Clients don’t necessarily care how much you know until they know how much you care.

			<span class="quote">It may seem obvious but it is surprising how many people go into a design presentation with no more specific an agenda than to “present the design”. That’s just too vague in nearly all cases.

We have found that our most successful professionals know how to approach a presentation with very specific and detailed outcomes that require very specific items to be discussed and agreed.

How can we narrow the purpose to very specific items?   “The purpose of the meeting is to decide if we need centralised meeting spaces or dispersed ones” is an example of something more specific.

It’s ok to have multiple purposes but they need to be as specific as possible and stated in advance or at the beginning.

<h4>Show the evolution</h4>

Assume they just stepped into this meeting from one where they were focused on something completely different. Allow them to refocus and adjust their mental frame rather than just leaping into the presentation. This helps get them in the moment and out of the issues they just left behind in their previous meeting.

			<span class="quote">One of the best ways is to provide the big picture of where you have been where you are and what lay ahead; the timeline of the project development or sequence that allows them to place today’s events in context.

<h4>Prepare your client sponsor.</h4>

Provide your key client sponsor an advanced review of what you intend to present. That has two benefits.

First, it can ensure your primary contact is not surprised. Most clients who are responsible for a project don’t want surprises. They want to be in control. Client sponsors or key client contact would rather know what you are going to present before hearing it for the first time in front of their colleagues.

The second thing is that it helps them understand and then work behind the scenes in advance of your presentation to smoothen the way to a decision. They may know where resistance is and be able to work some magic before the committee assembles.

<h4>Rehearse</h4>

Make time for rehearsal rather than work right up to the moment of going to a meeting. The most successful project leaders know the value of rehearsal and how to allow time for it. The process of presentation can often be a story. It works best if you develop that story with your team and rehearse main points as well as potential questions including which team member might respond and how.

			<span class="quote">Spontaneous presentations may sometimes work for teams that are very intimately familiar with one another and have a routine for who will interject comments and explanations. They can play off each other well. But many teams have individuals assembled for that one project and they need to develop their approach to who will play what role.

Discuss these approaches with your team if you find you are not always getting resolution to project issues as a result of your presentations. Let empathy with the client and clearly stated purpose be a starting point to your meetings.
